We search to include all trials with labels of AD or other terms related to AD and MCI, but exclude trials where AD is not the primary focus. We include trials in Phase 1, Phase 1/2, Phase 2, Phase 2/3, and Phase 3. We use the Common Alzheimer\'s Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify the targets of the test agents. CADRO categories include amyloid beta; tau; inflammation; synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection; and others. Based on Mechanism of Action (MoA) information, we classify agents as DMTs or as symptomatic therapies. We divide DMTs into biologics (e.g., monoclonal antibodies, vaccines) and small molecules. To determine if a drug is repurposed, we compare agents to the DrugBank database. We do not include trials of non‐pharmacologic therapeutic approaches such as exercise, supplements, or devices.\nsummary_of_chunk This chunk details the methodology used for the pipeline analysis, specifying the data source as clinicaltrials.gov with an index date of January 1, 2024.

DMTs are divided between small molecules (55%) and biologics (45%). Using the Common Alzheimer\'s Disease Research Ontology (CADRO), the study identifies the most common therapeutic targets as neurotransmitter receptors (22%), inflammation (20%), amyloid-beta (18%), and synaptic plasticity (12%). Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, including the approved lecanemab and the under-review donanemab, continue to be prominent in late-stage trials. The analysis highlights a decrease in new chemical entities, the significant role of repurposed drugs (31% of the pipeline), and the widespread use of biomarkers like amyloid PET and CSF analysis for patient selection in DMT trials.

          text: "chunk_id alzheimers_pipeline_2024_chunk_4\nchunk_text There are 48 Phase 3 trials assessing 32 drugs. Sixty‐six percent of agents (N = 21) in Phase 3 are DMTs, including nine biologics and 12 small molecules. The CADRO categories of agents in Phase 3 include 11 (34%) targeting transmitter systems and 7 (22%) targeting amyloid‐related processes. Key anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies in this phase include aducanumab, donanemab, gantenerumab, lecanemab, remternetug, and solanezumab. Other anti-amyloid agents are the small molecule valiltramiprosate. In total, 10 biological process categories are being addressed by agents in Phase 3 trials. Seventy-nine percent of Phase 3 trials are funded by the biopharmaceutical industry. These trials require a total of 36,998 participants, with DMT biologics accounting for 18,232. The mean recruitment time for a Phase 3 DMT biologic trial is 3.5 years, with a mean treatment period of 1.5 years. For DMT small molecules, recruitment takes 2.2 years with a 1-year treatment period. Symptomatic agent trials are generally shorter.\nsummary_of_chunk This chunk focuses on the 48 Phase 3 trials in the AD pipeline, noting that two-thirds of the 32 drugs are DMTs, with amyloid-related processes being the second most common target. It highlights the prominence of several late-stage anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, details the large participant requirements, and outlines the lengthy recruitment and treatment durations for these pivotal trials.\nkeywords Phase 3\nkeywords clinical trials\nkeywords donanemab\nkeywords lecanemab\nkeywords amyloid beta\nrelevance_to_anti_amyloid_therapy This chunk is highly relevant as it details the most advanced anti-amyloid therapies in the pipeline.

The 2024 pipeline includes 164 trials assessing 127 drugs, a notable contraction from 187 trials and 141 drugs in 2023. The majority of agents (76%) are disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with the remainder targeting cognitive enhancement or neuropsychiatric symptoms. DMTs are divided between small molecules (55%) and biologics (45%). Using the Common Alzheimer\'s Disease Research Ontology (CADRO), the study identifies the most common therapeutic targets as neurotransmitter receptors (22%), inflammation (20%), amyloid-beta (18%), and synaptic plasticity (12%). Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies, including the approved lecanemab and the under-review donanemab, continue to be prominent in late-stage trials. The analysis highlights a decrease in new chemical entities, the significant role of repurposed drugs (31% of the pipeline), and the widespread use of biomarkers like amyloid PET and CSF analysis for patient selection in DMT trials. The paper concludes that despite recent therapeutic successes, the pipeline has shrunk, and it estimates the average drug development time to be approximately 13 years, underscoring the need for improved trial recruitment and sustained investment to accelerate progress."

        text: "chunk_id alzheimers_pipeline_2024_chunk_3\nchunk_text On the Index Date of January 1, 2024, there were 164 clinical trials for AD assessing 127 drugs. This included 48 trials testing 32 drugs in Phase 3; 90 trials assessing 81 drugs in Phase 2; and 26 trials testing 25 drugs in Phase 1. Compared to the 2023 pipeline, there are fewer trials (164 vs. 187), fewer drugs (127 vs. 141), and fewer new chemical entities. Most drugs in the pipeline are DMTs, with 96 agents (76%) in this category. Of these, 53 (55%) are small molecules and 43 (45%) are biologics. The remaining agents target cognitive enhancement (12%) or neuropsychiatric symptoms (13%). Agents in the pipeline address a wide array of targets as classified by CADRO. Twenty-eight drugs (22%) target neurotransmitter receptors; 25 agents (20%) target neuroinflammation; 23 therapies (18%) target amyloid beta protein (Aß) processes; 15 drugs (12%) address synaptic plasticity/neuroprotection; and 11 agents (9%) target tau‐related processes.
